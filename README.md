# Set of Image Restoration Algorythms

If you are intrested in image restoring, check out this repository. In near future, next features will be added. 

Currently only one filter is supported, but we, as science club, have plans to create some more filters.
Whole implemetation is C++ based, with Qt framework support, to make Image displaying, loading and exporting easier, and focus on algorytmics.
